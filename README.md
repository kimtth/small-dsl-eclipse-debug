# smallD 🧸  
Language Engineering as a Toy Language — the name is *Small D*. Integrated with the Eclipse Debug UI 🐞, it provides a simple interpreter and debugger.

## Overview 🔍

1. `org.xtext.labs.mydsl.interpreter` is fully developed and designed based on parsing results. It’s **not** a built-in feature of the Xtend framework.
2. The interpreter is integrated with the Eclipse Debug UI — this is an **independent** module, not relying on Xtend.
3. Code editor functionalities are provided and fixed by the Xtend framework.
4. Minimap view and deployment are implemented via Eclipse plugin development.
5. ANTLR parses the language definition file at `org.xtext.labs.mydsl/src/org/xtext/labs/Mydsl.xtext`. Once parsing is complete and the AST is generated, it becomes the foundation for all language customization and engineering.

## What and Why is small D? ❓

Small D is a *toy language* for exploring Language Engineering.  
“D” stands for **DSL** (Domain-Specific Language). Unlike general-purpose languages like C or Java, DSLs are tailored for specific tasks or domains.

Normally, implementing a new language doesn’t make sense for time- or budget-constrained projects. But sometimes, it's necessary. Unfortunately, simple and practical references are hard to find, and most DSLs are proprietary, making examples rare.

Even finding debugger documentation often leads to low-level gdb or obscure references — not practical for newcomers. That’s why I created a small language with essential IDE features for learning purposes.

> I hope it helps you, too. 🙌

## Blueprint 🗺️

![roadmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13846660/28236758-70618150-6969-11e7-8913-98eb604a697b.png)

- **What**: Lexer 🪓 → Parser 📜 → Interpreter 🧠 → Debuggable Interpreter 🐛 → Eclipse Debug UI 🎛️  
- **Intermediate Products**: Token (lexer) → AST (parser) → Call Stack & Symbol Table (interpreter)  
- **How**: Using Xtext Framework 🛠️ + Custom Implementations 💡

## Features of the small D Project 🌟

### 1. small DSL language with Xtext ✍️

Features:
- Error Checking
- Semantic/Syntax Coloring
- Outline View
- Hover Tooltips
- Auto-completion (Proposal)
- Scoping, Cross-referencing, Labeling
- Minimap View
- Formatting, 🛠️ Quick Fix
- Folding, 📌 Go-To Declaration

> 🧱 Xtext documentation is sparse, sometimes outdated, and the community is small — but it's still better than nothing.

### 2. Debuggable Interpreter & Debugger 🐛

- Features a 🧮 call stack, 🧾 symbol table, and 🧬 AST
- Interpreter can **suspend ⏸️** and **resume ▶️** based on commands

### 3. Integration with Eclipse Debug UI 🎛️

- Communication with Eclipse Debug UI:
  - **Request Socket <=> Response (data)**
  - **Event Socket**

### 4. Eclipse Product for Deploying 🚀

- Use the Eclipse Product export wizard 🧙‍♂️
- Project: `org.xtext.labs.mydsl.product`
- File: `DSLDeveloper.product`

🛠️ For installers:  
> Use [Inno Setup](https://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) — free and easy 💸

### 5. Java & C# Generator 🔄

- DSL code can be **converted to Java and C#** (though not perfectly)
- In C#, all function parameters are converted using `ref` (demonstrates call-by-reference) 🔁  
> 💡 Pascal is a well-known language that supports call-by-reference.

## small D Specification 📚

Sample code can be found in `org.xtext.labs.mydsl.product/src`

![grammar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13846660/28236760-7066258e-6969-11e7-935a-c328ae9dabab.PNG)

### Supported Types & Constructs
- `num`, `string`, `bool`
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- `if ~ else` (no `else if`)
- `while` loop only
- Function definition: `def function_name() {}`
- `launch_main` is the entry point
- Scope resolution: local → global fallback
- No object-oriented features

### Limitations ⚠️

- Not supporting Direct function calls in expressions

  ❌ `printstr(numtostr(b))`  
  ✅
  ```dsl
  a = numtostr(b)
  printstr(a)
  ```

- Grammar supports multiple operations, but interpreter doesn't yet (lazy dev 😅)
  ➕ You can define operator precedence manually if needed

### Standard Functions (for testing only) 🧪

* `printstr(varStr)` 🖨️
* `strjoin(var1, var2)` 🔗
* `varArr = strsplit(var1, "delimiter")` 
* `varStr = numtostr(varNum)` 
* `getargs(index)` 

## Setup & Deploy ⚙️

### Setup 🛠️

1. Import the project into Eclipse
2. Export `org.xtext.labs.mydsl.interpreter` as a **Runnable JAR**
3. Copy the JAR to your path
4. Open `DSLDeveloper.product`
5. Use Eclipse Product Export Wizard (in Overview tab)
6. Create a new DSL file from MyDsl project

### Deploy Interpreter 🚀

* Export `debugDSL.jar` from `org.xtext.labs.mydsl.interpreter`
* Copy to:
  `D:\DSLDeveloper\debug\debugDSL.jar` *(example path)*

### Equinox Configuration 🧩

Reference: [Robert Wloch’s Blog](http://www.robertwloch.net)

```
1. In the Plug-ins tab change the Launch with select box to plug-ins select below only and uncheck the Target Platform subtree and check the two options below the plug-ins list. In the search field above the plug-ins list enter equinox. and check the equinox.ds plug-in: In the filtered list also check the equinox.util plug-in: Now enter appl in the search field and check the ui.ide.application plug-in:
2. Switch to the Configuration tab and check Clear the configuration area before launching. This ensures that runtime Eclipse doesn't cache plug-in configuration which avoids occational pitfalls.
3. The last change needs to be done in the Common tab. Switch the radio choice to Shared file and enter the Project Explorer path to the product plug-in: /de.rowlo.testgenerator.testdsl.product. This will tell Eclipse to save that run configuration in a launcher file in the specified location:
4. Finally switch back to the Plug-ins tab, clear the search filter and check the checkbox Validate plug-ins automatically prior to launching. Then click several times on Add Required Plug-ins right of the plug-ins list. You can stop clicking when the number of selected plug-ins does not change no more. To check if nothing's missing click on Validate Plug-ins. Eclipse should tell you that no problems were detected. Click on Apply and Close the dialog now.
```

⚠️ Known issue:
Sometimes, Variables view is empty after suspend.

> Workaround: switch view or reload it.
